<!-- ok- now i would like for the women to tell me what her goal is for learning AI to create social media content and for her professional career as a software developer. Her name is Laney and she considers her self a mid level developer and has been working in technology for over 6 years. She has ideas of the things she can create with AI but doesn't really know how to implement them in a way to generate income.

Laney speaking:

“My goal for learning AI is to turn my ideas into things people actually want to use, share, and pay for.

On the social media side, I want to create content that blends creativity with technical insight—short videos, visuals, and explanations that show how AI can simplify life, spark ideas, and help people build faster without needing to be experts. I don’t just want to follow trends; I want to explain them in a way that feels approachable, especially for people who look like me or come from non-traditional tech paths.

Professionally, as a mid-level software developer with over six years in tech, I see AI as the bridge to my next level. I want to use it to:

Prototype ideas faster

Build small products and tools on my own

Automate parts of development and content creation

Expand from “developer” into “creator and builder of solutions”

I have a lot of ideas—apps, digital tools, educational content, productivity helpers—but my challenge is implementation. I’m still figuring out how to connect AI tools, workflows, and platforms in a way that turns those ideas into real income streams. My goal is to learn how to move from concept → execution → monetization, so AI becomes not just a curiosity, but a multiplier for my skills and my career.”
