<!-- ok- now i would like for the women to tell me what her goal is for learning AI to create social media content and for her professional career as a software developer. Her name is Laney and she considers her self a mid level developer and has been working in technology for over 6 years. She has ideas of the things she can create with AI but doesn't really know how to implement them in a way to generate income.

Laney speaking:

“My goal for learning AI is to turn my ideas into things people actually want to use, share, and pay for.

On the social media side, I want to create content that blends creativity with technical insight—short videos, visuals, and explanations that show how AI can simplify life, spark ideas, and help people build faster without needing to be experts. I don’t just want to follow trends; I want to explain them in a way that feels approachable, especially for people who look like me or come from non-traditional tech paths.

Professionally, as a mid-level software developer with over six years in tech, I see AI as the bridge to my next level. I want to use it to:

Prototype ideas faster

Build small products and tools on my own

Automate parts of development and content creation

Expand from “developer” into “creator and builder of solutions”

I have a lot of ideas—apps, digital tools, educational content, productivity helpers—but my challenge is implementation. I’m still figuring out how to connect AI tools, workflows, and platforms in a way that turns those ideas into real income streams. My goal is to learn how to move from concept → execution → monetization, so AI becomes not just a curiosity, but a multiplier for my skills and my career.”

Refine this prompt for a video generator: In his vibrant bedroom a African American boy name Kitai sits on his bed playing his Xbox. His bedroom door opens and his mother enters and ask if he is going to go outside to get some fresh air today. While continuing to playing the game he replies "Can I take the Xbox with me" and looks at his mother with a slight grin and his mother replies "Of Course Not!!!!" Then he replies "You have answered your own question" while continuing to play the game during the whole interaction with his mother

REFINED PROMPT
Inside a vibrant, colorful bedroom, an African American boy named Kitai sits on his bed, fully focused on playing an Xbox game. The room reflects his personality with youthful décor and soft, natural lighting. The bedroom door opens and his mother enters, standing near the doorway.

She asks, with a gentle but firm tone, if he plans to go outside and get some fresh air today. Kitai continues playing without pausing the game. Without looking away from the screen at first, he casually replies, “Can I take the Xbox with me?”

He then briefly turns his head to look at his mother with a playful grin. She responds immediately and emphatically, “Of course not!” Kitai smirks, turns his attention back to the game, and replies, “You’ve answered your own question,” continuing to play throughout the entire interaction.

Character movements are natural and human-like, with subtle hand motions on the controller, realistic head turns, expressive facial reactions, and smooth conversational timing. -->
